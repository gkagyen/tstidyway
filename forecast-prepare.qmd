# Preparing for Forecasting {#sec-preparing-for-forecasting}

Exploring our time series has given us a deep understanding of our time series data – we have been able to identify its patterns, rhythms and peculiarities. Now we stand at the crucial bridge between understanding what our data has been doing and predicting what it will do next.

Preparing for forecasting is the process of transforming our explored data into a modelling ready series, ensuring our forecasts are built on solid statistical foundations rather than shaky assumptions.

## Why Preparation Matters

Skipping proper preparation is like building a house without a foundation – It might look good initially, but it will not withstand the test of time. Proper preparation ensures:

-   **Model Reliability**: Transformations and stationarity checks prevent statistical violations that undermines forecast accuracy.
-   **Realistic Evaluation**: Careful train-test splitting provides honest assessment of how your models will perform in the real world.
-   **Efficient Modelling**: Clean, structured data saves you from debugging mysterious model failures later.

## The Journey Ahead

Before we can leverage powerful forecasting algorithms, we must address some fundamental prerequisites that transform our explored data into a modelling ready series. This section will guide you through three essential preparation stages that directly impact forecast accuracy and reliability.

-   @sec-variance-stabilisation: This chapter will provide crucial knowledge on why and when variance stabilisation is necessary, how to identify heteroscedasticity (unequal variance) in a time series and applying Box-cox transformations to achieve constant variance. It goes on to further interpret the effects of different transformation parameters and how to assess their effectiveness via visualisations.

-   @sec-checking-stationarity: In this chapter, you will learn to understand what stationarity means and its importance in forecasting, how to use statistical tests to detect non-stationarity and how to implement **differencing** techniques to achieve stationarity. We will also cover when seasonal differencing is needed and how to keep the transformed series easy to interpret.

-   @sec-splitting-data: This chapter will teach you how to split a time series data into training and testing sets while keeping its structure intact. You will understand why temporal partitioning is important, how to choose the right split ratio and when to use time series cross-validation for better evaluation. We will also look at common mistakes that lead to data leakage and how to avoid them.

Time series forecasting has special requirements that demand careful preparation. Unlike cross-sectional data, time series violates many standard statistical assumptions, requiring transformations and structured validations to produce reliable predictions.

## What This Means for You

The goal of preparation is to ensure your forecasting models have the best possible chance of success by giving them clean, appropriate data to learn from. By the end of this section, you will understand how to diagnose and fix common time series issues, create robust validation framework, and transform your data into its most forecast-ready state – setting the stage for building powerful and reliable forecasting models in the next section.
