# Dealing with Time Gaps and Irregularities {#sec-dealing-with-time-gaps-and-irregularities}

Real-world data is messy. Sensors failz, public holidays happen, data does not get entered. This leads to gaps in your time series â€“ missing entries in the index where we expect a measurement. Traditional data frames ignore this, but `tsibble` helps you find and handle them.

## Why Time Gaps Matter

Many time series models and visualisations assume ***regular spaced data.*** Gaps can lead to errors, misleading plots and inaccurate forecasts.

## How tsibble Helps

We can check the time gaps in our tsibble using the `scan_gaps` function from the `tsibble` package. This is a very handy function that compares our actual data against a complete regular timeline and tells us exactly what is missing.

The next chapter is a bonus one. It briefly describes how to import data (time series data) into R from various sources with a simple code illustration.
