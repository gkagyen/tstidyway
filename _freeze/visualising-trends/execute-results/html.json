Since we now have control over date manipulations and feature engineering from the previous chapters, visualisation is the next crucial step.\n\nA well crafted plot can instantly reveal what might take hours to discover through numerical analysis alone. In this chapter we will learn how to visualise our time series data using the flexible, customisable world of `ggplot2` and the specialised, intelligent `autoplot()` function from the `feasts` package.\n\n## Basic Time Series Plots with `ggplot2`\n\n### Line Plots for Time Series\n\nWe will start with the most fundamental time series visualisation, the line plot. It is perfect for showing how values change over time\n\nTo demonstrate this we will use the `gh_ts` tsibble data and filter some few key indicators (`Population_total`, `Life expectancy at birth`, `infant mortality_per_1000_births` and `Cereal yield _kg per hectare`).\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# select key variables for tsibble for exploration \ngh_key <- gh_ts |>    \n  filter(     \n    indicator_name  %in% c(       \n      \"Population_total\",       \n      \"Life expectancy at birth\",       \n      \"Infant mortality_per_1000_births\",       \n      \"Cereal yield _kg per hectare\"     \n      )   \n    )\n```\n:::\n\n\nAfter filtering our data into a manageable subset (`gh_key`), we can now go ahead and create individual line plots for each of the four indicators filtered on. We will use the same basic `ggplot2` syntax to produce these plots where we define aesthetics (`aes`), specify the geometry (`geom_line` for a line plot) and add labels (`labs`).\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# basic line plot for population total \npop_plot <- gh_key |>    \n  filter(indicator_name == \"Population_total\") |>    \n  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = value)) +   \n  geom_line(linewidth = 0.7) +   \n  labs(     \n    title = \"Ghana Annual Total Population (1960-2024)\",     \n    x = 'Year',     \n    y = \"Total Population\"   )  \npop_plot\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Time Series Plot of Ghana Annual Total Population from 1960 to 2024](visualising-trends_files/figure-html/fig-gh-pop-1.png){#fig-gh-pop fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# basic line plot for life expectancy at birth \nlifexp_plot <- gh_key |>    \n  filter(indicator_name == \"Life expectancy at birth\") |>    \n  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = value)) +   \n  geom_line(linewidth = 0.7) +   \n  labs(     \n    title = \"Ghana Yearly Life Expectancy at Birth (1960-2024)\",     \n    x = 'Year',     \n    y = \"Life Expectancy at Birth\"   )  \nlifexp_plot\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Time Series Plot of Ghana Yearly Life Expectancy at Birth from 1960 to 2024](visualising-trends_files/figure-html/fig-gh-lifexp-1.png){#fig-gh-lifexp fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# basic line plot for infant mortality \nInfmort_plot <- gh_key |>    \n  filter(indicator_name == \"Infant mortality_per_1000_births\") |>    \n  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = value)) +   \n  geom_line(linewidth = 0.7) +   \n  labs(     \n    title = \"Ghana Annual Infant Mortality (1960-2024)\",     \n    x = 'Year',     \n    y = \"Infant Mortality/1000 births\"   )  \nInfmort_plot\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Time Series Plot of Ghana Yearly Infant Mortality from 1960 to 2024](visualising-trends_files/figure-html/fig-gh-inf-mort-1.png){#fig-gh-inf-mort fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# basic line plot for cereal yield \ncyield_plot <- gh_key |>    \n  filter(indicator_name == \"Cereal yield _kg per hectare\") |>    \n  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = value)) +   \n  geom_line(linewidth = 0.7) +   \n  labs(     \n    title = \"Ghana Yearly Cereal Yield (1960-2024)\",     \n    x = 'Year',     \n    y = \"Cereal Yield/Hectare\")  \ncyield_plot\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Time Series Plot of Ghana Annual Cereal Yield from 1960 to 2024](visualising-trends_files/figure-html/fig-gh-cereal-1.png){#fig-gh-cereal fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nEach of the above code block generates a standard line plot for one of the selected indicators. this line of code `ggplot(aes(x = date, y = value))` sets up the aesthetic mapping with time (`date`) on the x-axis and the values (`value`) on the y-axis. `geom_line()` creates the line connecting the data points and the `linewidth = 0.7` sets the thickness of the line produced. The `labs()` function makes it possible to add informative titles and labels to the plots which you can specify as a string of texts (characters).\n\nWe can clearly see the **dominant** time series characteristic of these plots which is a **strong trend**. The annual total population plot shows a **steep, continuous upward trend** which signifies an accelerated population growth over the entire 64 year period. The life expectancy plot also shows a similar **strong, persistent positive trend,** illustrating how life expectancy has increased from around 45yrs between 1960 and 1970 to over 65yrs in 2024. This sharp increase can be attributed to improved medical care, public health and nutrition over the decades.\n\nThe plot for annual infant mortality has a **continuous negative trend**, indicating how infant mortality has fallen dramatically, dropping from over 120 per 1000 births in 1960 to under 30 in 2024. This reinforces the conclusion of improving health and sanitation from the life expectancy plot. The yearly cereal yield over the 64-year period also shows a generally **positive long-term trend,** but with significant fluctuations (spikes and dips) compared to the other plots. A pronounced upward acceleration is visible after the mid 1980s and especially after 2000. The sharp rise after 1980 likely reflects the intervention of the IMF (international monetary fund) and adoption of the Economic Recovery Program (ERP) in 1983 which significantly boosted the countries economy and reduced poverty levels.\n\n### Introducing `autoplot()`\n\nWhiles ggplot gives you control, `autoplot()` from the feasts package provides intelligent defaults specifically designed for time series data. We can plot the same cereal yield time series in @fig-gh-cereal with the `autoplt()` function using the code below\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# simple autoplot for cereal yield\ncyield_autoplot <- gh_key |>    \n  filter(indicator_name == \"Cereal yield _kg per hectare\") |>\n  autoplot(value, linewidth = 0.7) + \n  labs(     \n    title = \"Ghana Yearly Cereal Yield (1960-2024)\",     \n    x = 'Year',     \n    y = \"Cereal Yield/Hectare\") \ncyield_autoplot\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Time Series Plot of Ghana Annual Cereal Yield from 1960 to 2024 using the autoplot function](visualising-trends_files/figure-html/fig-cereal-autoplot-1.png){#fig-cereal-autoplot fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe `autoplot()` function is quick and saves time with aesthetic mappings and geometry specifications when using traditional `ggplot2` layers. Although it actually is a specialised `ggplot2` function, it automatically respects the **index** (time) and **key** (series) of the time series data (`tsibble`). It chooses appropriate geometry, formats date axes appropriately and applies sensible styling. All other `ggplot2` graphical layers can be added to the `autoplot()` like we do in traditional `ggplot2` graphs.\n\n### Enhancing Basic Plots\n\nLet us make our `cyield_plot` more informative by adding some additional features and improving the styling.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# basic line plot for cereal yield \nenhanced_cyield_plot <- gh_key |>    \n  filter(indicator_name == \"Cereal yield _kg per hectare\") |>    \n  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = value)) +   \n  geom_line(linewidth = 0.7) +  \n  geom_point(aes(colour = value >= 1000), size = 1.5) +\n  scale_colour_manual(\n     na.translate = FALSE,\n    values = c(\"TRUE\" = 'darkgreen',\"FALSE\" = 'red',\"NA\" = NULL),\n    labels = c(\"FALSE\" = 'False', \"TRUE\" = 'True',\"NA\" = NULL),\n    name = \"High Yield\"\n  ) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = ymd(\"1983-04-20\"),\n             colour = 'navy',\n             linetype = 'dashed',\n             linewidth = 0.65) +\n  labs(     \n    title = \"Ghana Yearly Cereal Yield (1960-2024)\", \n    subtitle = \"Vertical line indicates Year of Adopting ERP Policy\",\n    x = 'Year',     \n    y = \"Cereal Yield per Hectare\"\n  )  +\n  geom_smooth(method = 'loess', se=FALSE) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5)\n  )\nenhanced_cyield_plot\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Time Series Plot of Ghana Annual Total Cereal Yield with Additional Features to Enhance Visual Storytelling](visualising-trends_files/figure-html/fig-gh-enhanced-cereal-1.png){#fig-gh-enhanced-cereal fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe plot above tells a detailed story about the Cereal Yield in Ghana from 1960 to 2024. Here we explicitly combine the time series data (`gh_key` ) with two very interesting **engineered features** – a **threshold flag** (red and green points) and a **policy intervention marker** (dashed vertical line) with a smoothed trend line (blue curved line). we use the `ggplot2` package to build this detailed visualisation layer by layer.\n\nWe start the whole process by filtering out the data to only include `cereal yield _kg per hectare` just like we did for @fig-gh-cereal we then initialise our plot, mapping the `date` and `value` columns to the x and y-axis respectively. `geom_line(...)` draws the the raw time series data. Inside the `geom_point()` function we create a threshold flag (High Yield) where we add points to the time series line and the colour is determined by the logical expression `value >= 1000`. If the yield is ≥ 1000, the colour is mapped to `TRUE` and if the yield is ˂ 1000, the colour is mapped to `FALSE.`\n\nWe use `scale_colour_manual(...)` to explicitly assign `TRUE` and `FALSE` logical values to specific colours and label names where `TRUE` (High Yield) is mapped to **dark green** and `FALSE` (Low Yield) is mapped to **red**. `name = \"High Yield\"` sets the title of the legend to \"High Yield\". The yield value filtered from the data contains some data so our logical expression will automatically return `NA`'s together with the logical flag of `TRUE` and `FALSE`. By default the `NA`'s a labelled as part of the legend so we need to explicitly omit them with `na.translate = FALSE` and then map its colour to `NULL`.\n\nThe next feature that enhances the plots visual appeal is a vertical line that marks the point of policy change, a crucial contextual feature. `geom_vline()` helps us to achieve this feat. It draws a vertical line fixed at a particular point on the x-axis. This fixed x-intercept is set at the exact date of the intervention corresponding to the adoption of Ghana's Economic Recovery Program (ERP) using `xintercept = ymd(\"1983-04-20\")`.\n\nThe final feature is a smoothed trend line which is drawn using the **LOESS** (Locally estimated Scatter-plot Smoothing) method with the help of `geom_smooth()`. This method is an excellent tool for creating flexible non-linear trend lines. `se = FALSE` suppresses the standard error band around the smooth line, keeping the plot clean. `theme(...)` is used to customise all aspects of the plot but for this we only use it to centre the **title** and **subtitle**.\n\n## Multiple Time Series Plots for Comparison\n\n### Multiple Series with `autoplot()`\n\nThe `autoplot()` function truly shines when working with multiple time series data. However, it only works best when the series has the same value range since they are all plotted on a single graph.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngh_key |> autoplot(value, linewidth = 0.7)\n\ngh_key |> filter(\n  indicator_name %in% c(\"Infant mortality_per_1000_births\", \"Life expectancy at birth\")\n) |> autoplot(value, linewidth = 0.7)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![_ \"Multiple series with autoplot (different value scales)\" _ \"Multiple series with autoplot (resonable range value scale)\"](visualising-trends_files/figure-html/fig-multi-auto-1.png){#fig-multi-auto-1 fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![_ \"Multiple series with autoplot (different value scales)\" _ \"Multiple series with autoplot (resonable range value scale)\"](visualising-trends_files/figure-html/fig-multi-auto-2.png){#fig-multi-auto-2 fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNotice how the plot in @fig-multi-auto-1 shows all the keys for all the series in the legend but the plot has only two lines representing `population_total` and `life expectancy at birth`. This happens because all the 4 series keys have varying range of values that would not fit perfectly in a single plot with a fixed scale. For example `Population_total` (in tens of millions) alongside `life expectancy at birth` (in hundreds) on the same y-axis renders the smaller series nearly flat and invisible.\n\nThe plot in @fig-multi-auto-2 however is able to display all the two series keys in the legend because their value ranges fall within the y-axis scale of values although their appearance do not truly reflect their true characteristic if they were visualised individually as seen in @fig-gh-inf-mort and @fig-gh-lifexp.\n\n### Faceted Plots\n\nTo overcome the hurdle of inconsistent series value ranges on a single axis, we can facet our plots into separate panels using `facet_wrap()` from `ggplot2` together with the `autoplot()` function. This allows each series to use its own optimised y-axis scale, enabling clear visual comparison of trends and patterns.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngh_key |> \n  autoplot(value, linewidth = 0.7) +\n  facet_wrap(vars(indicator_name), scales = 'free_y') +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Multiple Indicators in Ghana\",\n    subtitle = \"Faceted by Variable\",\n    x = 'Year'\n  ) +\n  # remove legend from plot\n  theme(legend.position = 'none')\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Faceted Time Series Plot of All Keys within the `gh_key` tsibble Dataset](visualising-trends_files/figure-html/fig-facet-1.png){#fig-facet fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe code output displays or four plots – each in its own panel. The core function in the above code is `facet_wrap(vars(indicator_name),...)`. It tells ggplot2 to create a new, separate panel for every unique value found in the `indicator_name` column. The next critical aspect is `scales = 'free_y'`, which instructs the `facet_wrap()` function to allow the y-axis to vary independently in each panel. Without this all panels would share the same scale, defeating the purpose of faceting the series. We finally remove the **legend** using `theme(legend.position = 'none')` since the series labels become redundant because they are given by the facet titles.\n\nFaceted plots are the standard, most effective way to visualise multiple disparate time series data streams.\n\n## Visualising Monthly Data\n\nSo far we have only seen the series plot of yearly data from the `gh_ts` data set. While the yearly visuals is a good way of identifying long term trends it mostly lacks seasonality. On the other hand a monthly dataset has monthly frequency, which opens up possibilities for detecting cyclical **seasonal patterns**\n\n### Seasonal Patterns and Trends\n\nTo demonstrate seasonal patterns which is mostly common in monthly datasets (repeating every 12 months) we will use the `sales_ts` tsibble.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Basic monthly time series plot\nsales_ts |> \n  autoplot(Sales, linewidth = 0.7) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Monthly Sales (2015-2019)\",\n    y = \"Sales (₵)\",\n    x = \"Date\"\n  )\n\nsales_ts |> \n  autoplot(Units_Sold, linewidth = 0.7) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Monthly Items Sold (2015-2019)\",\n    y = \"Items\",\n    x = \"Date\"\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![A time Series Plot Showing Monthly Frequency of Sales from 2015 to 2019](visualising-trends_files/figure-html/fig-month-plot-1.png){#fig-month-plot-1 fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Another Similar Time Series Plot From the Same Data But Showing Monthly Items Sold from 2019 to 2015](visualising-trends_files/figure-html/fig-month-plot-2.png){#fig-month-plot-2 fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe two plots show some similar patterns, which is expected since sales is directly related to items sold.\n\nThe monthly sales series exhibits repeating seasonal peaks and troughs within each year and the pattern appears to involve some distinct high months (peaks) and low months (valleys) annually. This is the **annual seasonality** that most monthly datasets reveal. We can equally visualise the seasonal plot using the `gg_season()` function from the `ggtime` package. It overcomes the limitations of a simple line plot for monthly data by separating the data by year and laying the seasonal patterns on top of one another\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(ggtime)\nsales_ts |> \n  gg_season(Sales, period = \"1y\", linewidth = 0.7) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Seasonal Plot: Monthly Sales by Year\"\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![A Time Series Seasonal Sub-series Plot of Monthly Sales for 5 years](visualising-trends_files/figure-html/fig-season-1.png){#fig-season fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn terms of trend, there is no clear strong long term trend (upward or downward) across the 5-year period. for the monthly series plot in @fig-month-plot-1 and @fig-month-plot-2. The overall level of sales appears stationary fluctuating between GH₵10,000 and GH₵50,000. The seasonal plot however shows some declining trend in the 2016 season (olive green line) and a positive trend in the 2019 season (pink line).\n\nThe Sold items plot mirrors the Sales plot, showing the same seasonal pattern with minimal long-term trend. These plots confirm that any forecasting model for this data must account for the seasonal component.\n\nIn the next chapter we will delve into a more detailed visualisation of seasonal patterns ans trends.\n\n::: callout-important\nThe `gg_season()` function is part of the `feasts` package but has been **deprecated** and moved to the new `ggtime` package which was basically designed for visualising time series patterns. It contains functions for exploring time series patterns like trends, seasonality, cycles and holidays\n:::\n\n## Summary \n\nSo far you have mastered how to visualise our time series data using basic line plots with `ggplot2` and `autoplot()`. You have seen how `ggplot2` grants **absolute control** over every detail of your time series visualisations and how `autoplot()` delivers smart **time series-specific** defaults which drastically accelerates initial data exploration.\n\nYou can now make basic time series plots that reveal long term trends and seasonal cycles and also visualise multiple series simultaneously for comparative analysis.\n\nIn the next chapter, we are going to dive deeper into the `feasts` package to explore advanced time series decomposition, autocorrelation analysis and statistical pattern detection. The visual foundation we have built here will help us interpret those more advanced analysis.\n\nRemember that visualisation is both an **art** and a **science**. The best plots are those that not only look good but also communicate clear, accurate insights about your time series data. Practice creating different types of visualisations and always consider what story your data is trying to tell!\n",
