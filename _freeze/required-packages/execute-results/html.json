This is a supporting package that provides some underlying tools for the `fables` package\n\n::: callout-note\nthe `readr` and `lubridate` packages are already part of the **tidyverse package collections**. Once you install `tidyverse`, you do not need to install them again separately. `fabletools` is installed together with the `fables` package.\n:::\n\n## Installing the Packages\n\nTo install the above packages, run the following code **once** in your R console:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(c(\"tidyverse\", \"tsibble\", \"fable\", \"feasts\", \"readxl\"))\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: callout-tip\nIf you already have them installed, you do not need to reinstall. You can check if a package is installed by typing, for instance `\"fable\" %in% installed.packages()` to check if the `fable` package is already installed.\n:::\n\n### Loading the Packages\n\nAfter installing any package you have to load it before it becomes available for use. Each time you start a new R session, you will need to load the packages you will use again. Doing it correctly saves headaches. You can load a package in R with the `library()` function.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Load all packages\nlibrary(tidyverse)          # Core data wrangling + visualisation\nlibrary(tsibble)            # Tidy time series structure\nlibrary(fable)              # Forecasting\nlibrary(feasts)             # Time series exploration tools\nlibrary(readxl)             # Importing Excel files\n```\n:::\n\n\nThink of the install command as buying a tool and placing it in your garage **(your computer's library).** The `library()` function is like grabbing the tool from your garage and bringing it to your workbench **(your current R session)** so you can use it\n\n::: callout-tip\nIf you see a message like *\"there is no package called...\",* it means you have not installed it yet. Go back to the installation step.\n:::\n",
