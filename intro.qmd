## What is Time Series Data?

<<<<<<< HEAD
Time series data consists of observations recorded over time, usually at regular intervals (e.g., daily, monthly, yearly). Some examples include:

-   Monthly rainfall totals
-   Daily COVID-19 cases
-   Hourly temperature readings
-   Yearly population counts

What makes time series special is that time is not just a variable, It carries important structure and dependencies. What happened today can depend on what happened yesterday, last month or even last year. This temporal uniqueness is what makes time series very powerful.

## Why Time Series Analysis Matters

Time series analysis helps us to **understand the past, monitor the present, and predict the future**. Some real world examples are:

-   **Public Health:** Forecasting disease outbreaks or hospital admissions
-   **Finance:** Predicting stock prices, currency exchange rates, or sales revenue.
-   **Environmental Science:** Analysing temperature trends or rainfall patterns for climate studies
-   **Engineering:** Monitoring sensor data to detect faults or changes in performance

In many cases, this analysis supports decision making — whether it is planning resources, anticipating risks, or detecting unusual patterns.

## Traditional vs. Tidy Approach

Historically, time series in R has been handled using `ts` objects and packages like `forecast`. These are still useful, but they do not fit perfectly with the modern **tidy philosophy**; data frames, pipelines and consistent syntax.

We will follow the tidy time series workflow using the tidyverse ecosystem. The workflow uses packages from the **`tidyverts`** ecosystem:

-   `tsibble`: A tidy data structure for time series (like a tibble but with special time handling)
-   `fable`: For forecasting models (ARIMA, ETS, etc) in a tidy way.
-   `feasts`: For exploratory analysis (seasonal plots, decomposition, autocorrelation).
-   `lubridate`: For working with dates and times.
-   `ggplot2`: For beautiful and flexible visualisations
-   `dplyr`/`tidyr`/`tibble`: For general data wrangling

### The Tidy Time Series Workflow

The tidyverse ecosystem in R emphasises clean, readable code and consistent data structure. For time series, the modern approach uses the `tidyverts` suite of packages.\
The typical flow we will follow includes:

1.  🔧 **Data Preparation:** Load and tidy data. Convert the data to a `tsibble` object so R knows how to handle time.
2.  🔍 **Explore:** Visualise trends, seasonality, patterns
3.  🧩 **Decompose:** Break down components (trends, seasonal, noise)
4.  🖥️ **Model:** Fit forecasting models (simple —\> advanced)
5.  📈 **Forecast:** Generate future predictions
6.  📏 **Evaluate:** Check how good the forecasts are (accuracy assessment)

This workflow is clean, consistent and integrates smoothly with other tidyverse tools you might already know.

`tidyverse`: collection of packages designed for general data science

`tidyverts`: collection of packages specifically for time series analysis

They all follow the tidy philosophy, structure and grammar

### Data We Will Use

We will start with some built-in datasets from the `tsibble` package so every on can follow along without downloading external files:

-   `aus_production` — Quarterly production values for Australian industries.
-   `tourism` — Quarterly overnight trips in different Australian regions.

Later, we shall also show how to use **real-life datasets** — for example, population growth or GDP growth data from Ghana, to make the examples relatable and practical

You can download the datasets used here `gh_data.csv` .

### What You Will Need to Follow Along

1.  **Basic R Knowledge:** You should know how to load packages, run functions, and work with data frames
2.  **RStudio** installed for a smooth workflow
3.  Internet connection (for package installation and possible data download)

### By the end of this book, you will be able to:

-   Handle date/time data with ease
-   Explore time series visually and statistically
-   Build forecasts using tidyverse-style functions
-   Apply your skills to your own datasets in research or work
